## Unid

### intro
Unid aims to become a self contained reservation system with Web UI implemented in `Go` and backed by `PostgreSQL`.

### status
So far the main focus is basic plumbing, resources and capacity.

### mpa
Feel free to put a bookmark anywhere inside the app and use `back`/`forward`-buttons to navigate safely.
